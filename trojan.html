        <li class="t">  A Trojan virus spreads through legitimate-looking emails and files attached to emails,
          which are spammed to reach the inboxes of as many people as possible. When the email is opened and
          the malicious attachment is downloaded, the Trojan server will install and automatically run every
          time the infected device is turned on.<br/><br/> </li>
        <li class="t"> Devices can also be infected by a Trojan through social engineering tactics, which
          cyber criminals use to coerce users into downloading a malicious application. The malicious file
          could be hidden in banner advertisements, pop-up advertisements, or links on websites. <br/><br/> </li>
        <li class="t"> A computer infected by Trojan malware can also spread it to other computers. A
          cyber criminal turns the device into a zombie computer, which means they have remote control
          of it without the user knowing. Hackers can then use the zombie computer to continue sharing
          malware across a network of devices, known as a botnet.<br/><br/> </li>
        <li class="t"> A Trojan horse virus can often remain on a device for months without the user
          knowing their computer has been infected. However, telltale signs of the presence of a Trojan
          include computer settings suddenly changing, a loss in computer performance, or unusual activity
          taking place. The best way to recognize a Trojan is to search a device using a Trojan scanner or
          malware-removal software.</li>
